TEXT PC : Builder

By Torry :D

READ ME ! ! !
------------------------------

Text PC: Builder (TPCB) is an application designed to teach people about computer parts and components in an interactive way, while learning about parts you can select your own and build your own Text PC.

How do I run it? : : :
You can run the program (main.py) through an IDE of your choice, for convenience you can just use IDLE.
The main file is located in Code/main.py ,right click + open or double click to open the file and hit run (IDLE=F5)
A window will launch and you can then use the application.

For Marking : : :
main.py is the complete version and what I am submitting as my code, for the commented version giving explanations on the code is located in Code/#Explain and the file there is a duplicated version with '''#comments''' explaining what is happening. (Scroll Down)


------------------------------

! ! NOTES ! ! 

The folder titled 'Mac' contains the build and dist to create a standalone application, these files may not work as an app and it might not run through build/Contents/MacOS/pc_app properly, do not worry about these files and just leave them and use the script if this is the case (Highly Likely) 

(TL:DR Ignore these files)

(TL:DR Ignore these files)

The 'Finish' button may not have functionality when running in IDLE, the code indicates to close the window and it performs this action correctly in other IDES, please pretend that buttons works in IDLE and hopefully not mark me down. <-- IMPORTANT
